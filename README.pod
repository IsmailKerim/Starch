=head1 NAME

Web::Starch - Implementation independent session management.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $starch = Web::Starch->new(
        store => {
            class   => '::Memory',
            expires => 60 * 15, # 15 minutes
        },
    );
    my $new_session = $starch->session();
    my $existing_session = $starch->session( $key );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a generic interface to managing sessions, AKA the
session manager.

This module aims to be as fast as possible and be independent from
any particular framework which makes writing unit tests easier
for this distribution and for you as an implementor.

This class consumes the L<Web::Starch::Component> role, but modifies
the C<manager> attribute to just return itself.

=head1 PLUGINS

    my $starch = Web::Starch->new_with_plugins(
        ['::CookieArgs'],
        store => { class=>'::Memory' },
        cookie_name => 'my_session',
    );
    my $session = $starch->session();
    print $session->cookie_args->{name}; # my_session

Starch plugins are applied using the C<new_with_plugins> constructor method.
The first argument is an array ref of plugin names.  The plugin names can
be fully qualified, or relative to C<Web::Starch::Plugin>.  A leading C<::>
signifies that the plugin's package name is relative.

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=head2 store

The L<Web::Starch::Store> storage backend to use for persisting the session
data.  If a hashref is passed it is expected to contain at least a C<class>
key and will be blessed into a store object automatically.

The C<class> can be fully qualified, or relative to C<Web::Starch::Store>.
A leading C<::> signifies that the store's package name is relative.

The class must implement the C<set>, C<get>, and C<remove> methods.  Typically
a store class consumes the L<Web::Starch::Store> role which enforces this interface.

To find available stores you can search
L<meta::cpan|https://metacpan.org/search?q=Web%3A%3AStarch%3A%3AStore>.

Stores can be layered, such as if you want to put a cache in front of your
session database by using the L<Web::Starch::Store::Layered> store.

=head1 OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

=head1 digest_algorithm

The L<Digest> algorithm which L<Web::Starch::Session/digest> will use.
Defaults to C<SHA-1>.

=head2 factory

The underlying L<Web::Starch::Factory> object which manages all the plugins
and session/store object construction.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 session

    my $new_session = $starch->session();
    my $existing_session = $starch->session( $id );

Returns a new L<Web::Starch::Session> (or whatever L<Web::Starch::Factory/session_class>
returns) object for the specified session ID.

If no ID is specified, or is undef, then an ID will be automatically generated.

Additional arguments can be passed after the ID argument.  These extra
arguments will be passed to the session object constructor.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

The C<Web-Starch> distribution is shipped with minimal dependencies
and with no non-core XS requirements.  This is important for many people.

Unlike these modules this module tries to make as little assumptions
as possible and just provides raw session management with the ability
for implementors to alter behaviors as they see fit.
