=head1 NAME

Web::Starch - Implementation independent session management.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $starch = Web::Starch->new(
        expires => 60 * 15, # 15 minutes
        store => {
            class   => '::Memory',
        },
    );
    my $new_session = $starch->session();
    my $existing_session = $starch->session( $key );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a generic interface to managing sessions and is
often refered to as the "manager" in this documentation.

Please see L<Web::Starch::Manual> for some good holistic starter
documentation.

This class support method proxies as described in
L<Web::Starch::Manual/METHOD PROXIES>.

=head1 PLUGINS

    my $starch = Web::Starch->new_with_plugins(
        ['::CookieArgs'],
        store => { class=>'::Memory' },
        cookie_name => 'my_session',
    );
    my $session = $starch->session();
    print $session->cookie_args->{name}; # my_session

Starch plugins are applied using the C<new_with_plugins> constructor method.
The first argument is an array ref of plugin names.  The plugin names can
be fully qualified, or relative to the C<Web::Starch::Plugin> namespace.
A leading C<::> signifies that the plugin's package name is relative.

More information about stores can be found at L<Web::Starch::Manual/PLUGINS>.

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=head2 store

The L<Web::Starch::Store> storage backend to use for persisting the session
data.  A hashref must be passed and it is expected to contain at least a
C<class> key and will be converted into a store object automatically.

The C<class> can be fully qualified, or relative to the C<Web::Starch::Store>
namespace.  A leading C<::> signifies that the store's package name is relative.

More information about stores can be found at L<Web::Starch::Manual/STORES>.

=head1 OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

=head2 expires

How long, in seconds, a session should live after the last time it was
modified.  Defaults to C<60 * 60 * 2> (2 hours).

See L<Web::Starch::Manual/EXPIRATION> for more information.

=head2 expires_session_key

The session key to store the L<Web::Starch::Session/expires>
value in.  Defaults to C<__SESSION_EXPIRES__>.

=head2 modified_session_key

The session key to store the L<Web::Starch::Session/modified>
value in.  Defaults to C<__SESSION_MODIFIED__>.

=head2 created_session_key

The session key to store the L<Web::Starch::Session/created>
value in.  Defaults to C<__SESSION_CREATED__>.

=head2 factory

The underlying L<Web::Starch::Factory> object which manages all the plugins
and session/store object construction.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 session

    my $new_session = $starch->session();
    my $existing_session = $starch->session( $id );

Returns a new L<Web::Starch::Session> (or whatever L<Web::Starch::Factory/session_class>
returns) object for the specified session ID.

If no ID is specified, or is undef, then an ID will be automatically generated.

Additional arguments can be passed after the ID argument.  These extra
arguments will be passed to the session object constructor.
